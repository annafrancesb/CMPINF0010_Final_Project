### Description and Links to the datasets used:
#### Neighborhoods [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2]: Identifies the boundaries of the 90 unique Pittsburgh neighborhoods.
#### City of Pittsburgh Playing Fields [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playing-fields]: The relative density of playing fields in each neighborhood of Pittsburgh, as well as many other pieces of data related to these fields.
#### Healthy Ride Stations [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/healthyride-stations]: Healthy Ride is a public bike-sharing system in Pittsburg with over 100 stations and 550 bikes. This dataset contains the most recent information about the locations, names, bike id numbers, and dock capacities of each healthy ride station. 
#### Allegheny County Wooded Area Boundaries [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-wooded-area-boundaries1]: Defines the boundaries of wooded areas (stands of trees too numerous to plot as individual trees).

### Abstract: 
#### To summate our project in the very simplest terms, we set out to determine which neighborhood of the city of Pittsburgh would be the best for avoiding abduction by alien entities in UFOs. We settled on three metrics, characterized by the three datasets listed above. Bikes are important, as there's no way for a human to evade capture by UFO on foot. Playing fields represent the most common and wide open area with no sky coverage from tractor beams, and are to be avoided, and wooded areas represent the opposite - places where one can hide from tractor beams, which should be present in the final pick for best neighborhood - or, crucially, when incoporating the cross-referencing of our data, near enough to easily bike there. By comparing our datasets, we determined that the best region to avoid alien abduction is South Oakland, which has a high density of bikes, a lack of open playing fields, and is directly adjacent to highly wooded areas.
