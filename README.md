#### Healthy Ride Stations [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/healthyride-stations]: Healthy Ride is a public bike-sharing system in Pittsburg with over 100 stations and 550 bikes. This dataset contains the most recent information about the locations, names, bike id numbers, and dock capacities of each healthy ride station.

### Abstract: In the case of alien abductions, South Oakland is the safest neighborhood. We decided this based on three metrics: number of open fields, number of Healthy Ride stations, and percentage wooded area. South Oakland is the best because it has no open fields (where aliens can snatch you immediately), many bikes (so you can escape), and while it is not densely wooded, it's neighbors are (giving you somewhere to hide from the tractor beam).
